- Infra: Terraform and Lambda updated/synced for new schema
- All tests passing after bounding_box changes

## [0.0.10] - 2025-04-23

### Added
- One-time migration script for syncing device IDs from videos table to devices table
- Automated device ID deduplication and migration logic

### Changed
- Improved error handling and logging for device and video APIs

## [0.0.9] - 2025-04-23

### Changed
- `get_devices` now supports filtering, pagination, and sorting options matching backend API
- Client, Lambda handler, and tests updated for new device management logic
- Improved error handling and logging for device API
- All tests passing, including new video checks in recent data test

## [0.0.8] - 2025-04-15

### Added
- `.count()` methods for models, detections, classifications, and videos clients for efficient counting without retrieving all data
- Documentation and usage examples for count endpoints in the README

### Changed
- All test helpers now use `assert` and do not return values, ensuring pytest best practices
- Recommend using Poetry to run tests: `poetry run pytest`

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
